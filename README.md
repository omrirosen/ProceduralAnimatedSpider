# ProceduralAnimatedSpider
Final project for Unity course @ Shenkar College
I'm fascinated by procedural animation, so decided to challenge myself to create some of my own. Feel free to use this as a resource, hope you find it useful

Big thanks to Dan Kisler for the creepy green spider with fingers on his legs
